The design drew inspiration from ancient folding chairs. This can clearly be seen where the frame meets in an x pattern almost looking as if it could fold up in position. The original frame was even designed to bolt together. In fact, it was not until 1950 that the frame was redesigned using solid stainless steel providing a smoother finished look.

Originally designed for Perriand's private apartment in Paris she however exhibited the round swivel chair at the 1929 Salon d'Automne together with the LC armchairs, sofas and tables: and thus it was added to the family.",

It is like a two-dimensional drawing of a chair, rendered into three dimensions. The angular, graphic aesthetic, like a wire-frame drawing, was quite new in the early 2000s and in part arose from the use of CAD (computer aided design). With Chair One the designer Konstantin Grcic introduced a new paradigm into the design vocabulary of contemporary furniture, that of the crystal or fractal, and influenced many other designers.",
