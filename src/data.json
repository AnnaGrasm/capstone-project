Eero Aarnio commented on the design: “After I had made the Ball Chair I wanted to have the light inside it and so I had the idea of a transparent ball where light comes from all directions. The only suitable \"material\" is acrylic which is heated and blown into shape like a soap bubble”. Thanks to its special acoustics and soft leather seat, it will be like feeling pleasantly isolated even with many people around. Like the Ball Chair, also the Bubble Chair has become a well-known and desired piece of furniture all over the world.",

With this in mind, Aalto designed in 1931 the Paimio chair, which was manufactured of bent plywood and laminated wood. Aalto aimed at creating furniture which would promote the patients’ well-being both with their functionalism and beauty – the flowing structure of the Paimio chair was designed to make it easier for the patients to breathe. Paimio Sanatorium made Alvar Aalto a globally celebrated architect, but it was also the beginning of his career as a furniture \"designer\".",

The Barcelona chair quickly became an iconic modern classic design desired throughout the world. The Barcelona chair made extensive use of both leather piping and impressed buttons. The design drew inspiration from ancient folding chairs. This can clearly be seen where the frame meets in an x pattern almost looking as if it could fold up in position. The original frame was even designed to bolt together. In fact, it was not until 1950 that the frame was redesigned using solid stainless steel providing a smoother finished look. This Barcelona Chair Replica is a contemporary retake on a classic design which is ideal for your bedroom or office. This Barcelona Chair Replica has an angled seat that provides supreme relaxation.",

    "description": "The Ant Chair is a piece of furniture with a lot of personality and, by the way, world fame. It was designed by Arne Jacobsen in 1952 and consists of nine layers of compression moulded veneer. Ant' looks filigree and artistic, similar to the curves of a musical instrument. Its elegant form could almost hide its remarkable strength and comfort. Once seated, however, these qualities are clearly evident.",

Anyone who sees several Slice chairs together cannot fail to be touched by the playfulness fo the composition. From different visual angles, the Orange Slice shows several stages of 'curl up'. In fact, the chair seems to change shape every time you look at it.",
